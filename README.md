# Department-Log-management-system

Written in C in Ubuntu Linux

The idea is to give multiple users of a system a way to Log Daily quotas and for these logs to automatically be moved and stored in seperate directories depending on time of day, with error logs being checked

The users would be Managers of 4 specific departments each one required to submit a daily log of quotas

any missed logs on any given day will be counted as an error

logs must be submitted by department head by 7pm. Files are transferre dat 1am, and after file transfer is completed directory access is opened again.
